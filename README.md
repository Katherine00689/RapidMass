We have developed a versatile software platform, RapidMass. 
This tool integrates data pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation, enabling direct discrimination of unknown sample species with intuitive visual outputs. 
RapidMass offers several database search algorithms to achieve unknown sample scoring. 
Users can also create and manage personal databases, facilitating tailored analyses.
In addition, the software provides automatic identification of interested MS peaks and supports data from multiple instruments, including DI-MS and ASAP-MS. 
Other high-throughput mass spectrometry such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AI-MS), laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS), and several modified MS methodologies can also be tried with this software. 
The performance of RapidMass was validated using easily confused plant materials, with satisfactory results. 
Importantly, RapidMass features a user-friendly, visual interface, making it accessible to users without programming expertise.
